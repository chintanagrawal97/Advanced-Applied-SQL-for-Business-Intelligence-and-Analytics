----Top 10 Highest grossing actorss

select e.first_name,e.sum as Gross from (select actor.first_name , sum(payment.amount)
from rental 
inner join payment on rental.rental_id = payment.rental_id 
inner join inventory on rental.inventory_id = inventory.inventory_id 
inner join film on film.film_id = inventory.film_id 
inner join film_actor on film_actor.film_id = film.film_id 
inner join actor on actor.actor_id = film_actor.actor_id
group by actor.first_name)e order by sum desc limit 10

This query gave us the wrong results because the group by was done on first_name which is not unique. 
Do the group by on the id which is unique in the lookup table i.e actor_id then get the Name 


with base_table as (
select film_actor.actor_id , sum(payment.amount)
from rental 
inner join payment on rental.rental_id = payment.rental_id 
inner join inventory on rental.inventory_id = inventory.inventory_id 
inner join film on film.film_id = inventory.film_id 
inner join film_actor on film_actor.film_id = film.film_id 
group by film_actor.actor_id
)
select actor.first_name,base_table.sum as Gross from base_table
inner join actor on actor.actor_id = base_table.actor_id
order by sum desc limit 10

Create two tables using cte.
with base_table as (
select film_actor.actor_id , sum(payment.amount)
from rental 
inner join payment on rental.rental_id = payment.rental_id 
inner join inventory on rental.inventory_id = inventory.inventory_id 
inner join film on film.film_id = inventory.film_id 
inner join film_actor on film_actor.film_id = film.film_id 
group by film_actor.actor_id), top5 as (
select actor.first_name,base_table.sum as Gross,base_table.actor_id as id from base_table
inner join actor on actor.actor_id = base_table.actor_id
order by sum desc limit 5
) 
select top5.first_name,film.title
from top5  
inner join film_actor on top5.id = film_actor.actor_id
inner join film on film_actor.film_id = film.film_id
