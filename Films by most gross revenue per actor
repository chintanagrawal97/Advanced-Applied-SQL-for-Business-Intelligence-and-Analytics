So we will need to aggregate all the payments for our rentals to comute the gross revenue per film and then 
find the number of actors in that movie -- > then find the movie where the average gross per actor is highest 

==============

		select film_actor.actor_id ,payment.amount , inventory.inventory_id,film.film_id

select highest_gross.title , (highest_gross.gross/highest_gross.number_of_actors) as Average_Gross_per_Actor
from highest_gross
order by Average_Gross_per_Actor desc
